# Deployment Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. DatabaseIcon Import Error
- **Problem**: `DatabaseIcon` was imported from `@heroicons/react/24/outline` but not used in the component
- **Solution**: Removed the unused import from `frontend/src/app/admin/settings/page.tsx`
- **Files Modified**: `frontend/src/app/admin/settings/page.tsx`

### 2. Other Unused Icon Imports
- **Problem**: Several other icons were imported but not used in the settings page
- **Solution**: Removed unused imports: `UserGroupIcon`, `GlobeAltIcon`, `KeyIcon`, `DocumentTextIcon`
- **Files Modified**: `frontend/src/app/admin/settings/page.tsx`

### 3. Node.js Version Warning
- **Problem**: Vercel warning about automatic Node.js version upgrades
- **Solution**: Changed from `"node": ">=18.17"` to `"node": "18.17.x"` for more specific version control
- **Files Modified**: `frontend/package.json`

### 4. SWC Dependencies Warning
- **Problem**: Missing SWC dependencies in lockfile
- **Solution**: Added `.nvmrc` file with specific Node.js version and added `postinstall` script
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `frontend/package.json` (added postinstall script)
  - `frontend/.nvmrc` (new file)

## Build Configuration

The project uses Vercel for deployment with the following configuration:

- **Framework**: Next.js
- **Node.js Version**: 18.17.x
- **Build Command**: `npm run build` (runs in frontend directory)
- **Output Directory**: `frontend/.next`

## Next Steps

1. **Local Development**: Run `npm install` and `npm run build` in the frontend directory to ensure all dependencies are properly installed
2. **Deployment**: The fixes should resolve the build errors on Vercel
3. **Monitoring**: Check the build logs to ensure all warnings are resolved

## Notes

- All icon imports have been verified to be used in their respective components
- The Node.js version is now pinned to prevent automatic upgrades
- SWC dependencies should be automatically patched during the build process
